Hi, I’m @jamesjlandry
I’m a full stack developer. I'm currently a lead UI developer for my company who uses Angular as our primary Framework.
For side projects I tend to use React and various backend technologies. Right now I'm playing with Supabase's realtime backend as a service option. 
If you want to chat, It's easiest to reach me on <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesjlandry/'>LinkedIn</a>.
